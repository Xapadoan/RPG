    Dwarves lives inside mountains,
where they extract ore for the rest of
the world, for a fair price of course.
    They usually prefer staying between
them, because of other races making
fun of their litlle size. Nevertheless,
many dwarves are well integrated to
human cities because of their abilities
for smithing.
